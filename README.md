## Configuring
Animation duration can be adjusted via two separare constants in `src/screens/GameScreen.js`

On line 8, `ANIMATION_FADE_TIME` allows you to adjust the timing of the fade in and fade out animation of the creature.

On line 9, `ANIMATION_ON_SCREEN` allows you to adjust how long the creature remains on screen before animating out.
